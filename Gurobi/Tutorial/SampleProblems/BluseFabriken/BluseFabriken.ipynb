    "# BluseFabriken Problem\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "You have been recently hired as the supply chain manager of \n",
    "BluseFabriken, a company that manufactures and sells blouses \n",
    "that have been engineered for performance. Founded in 1982, \n",
    "BluseFabriken leaped to the top in its market with its \n",
    "revolutionary BF Shirt that could be used in both hot and \n",
    "cold seasons. The BF Shirt has remained its most successful and \n",
    "profitable product to date and as a result, the company has significantly grown its inventory. \n",
    "\n",
    "This year, BluseFabriken would like to improve its distribution to other Nordic and Central European countries. To support this initiative, your department has been allotted a large budget to construct two world-class warehouses that would start by maintaining a high inventory of BF Shirts. An external consultant has provided you with possible warehouse locations to choose from. Your role is to determine which location(s) would best serve the demands of BluseFabriken's wholesalers while minimizing costs. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are five candidate locations that you are considering for opening your warehouses. Due to limitations in your transportation capability, you can only select two of the five candidate locations to open the warehouses. Each warehouse that you could open would have both a fixed cost associated with storing inventory in it, and a transportation cost associated with shipping products out of it. The fixed cost is based on infrastructure and operating expenses, while the transportation cost is based on how far away the wholesalers are from the warehouses. The fixed cost and the per-kilometer per-shipment transportation cost for all five candidate locations are given by the following table: \n",

    "Every warehouse that you decide to open will have to make 40 shipments to each one of the wholesalers every year. The distance between each warehouse and wholesaler locations are as follows: \n",
